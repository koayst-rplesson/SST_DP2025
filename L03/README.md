It introduces Python type hints, enhancing code clarity and facilitating static type checking. It covers basic type annotations for variables and function return types, such as int, float, str, bool, and None. The lesson delves into type hints for collections like list, tuple, set, and dict, specifying element types within these structures. Additionally, it explains the use of Optional and Union types from Python's typing module to handle variables or return types that can accept multiple types or None. Practical examples throughout the notebook demonstrate how to implement these type hints, promoting better code documentation and error detection during development
