It introduces LangGraph, a framework designed to model workflows, processes, or computations as directed graphs. The focus is on building a basic chatbot using LangGraph's architecture, where nodes represent individual tasks or operations, and edges define the flow of information between these tasks.
<br/>
<br/>
It demonstrates how to create a StateGraph that defines the chatbot's state machine, adding nodes representing the Large Language Model (LLM) and specifying edges to determine how the bot transitions between states based on user input.
<br/>
<br/>It illustrates the process of chaining components to build a functional chatbot application, highlighting the practical application of LangGraph in developing interactive language model-based solutions.
