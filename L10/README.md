It demonstrates how to create a simple chain that translates the word 'Hello' into a specified language using LangChain's ChatPromptTemplate, ChatOpenAI model, and StrOutputParser. The example illustrates the process of chaining components to build a functional application, highlighting the practical application of LCEL in developing language model-based solutions.
